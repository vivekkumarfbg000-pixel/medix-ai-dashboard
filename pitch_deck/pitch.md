### Key Stats:

## 📌 The Problem
### "Pharmacy Management is Stuck in the 90s"
There are over 8 Lakh medical shops in India. 95% run on pen-and-paper or expensive, complicated desktop software they don't know how to use.

- **💸 Expiry Losses**: Shops lose ₹50K–₹1L/year due to expired medicines.
- **📦 Inventory Chaos**: No real-time tracking leads to lost revenue.
- **🖥️ Digital Divide**: Existing software (Marg/Tally) is too complex.
- **🏥 Chronic Care**: No method to manage recurring diabetes/heart patients.
- **🧾 Billing**: High difficulty in GST compliance and billing.
- **⚠️ Safety**: No checks for drug interactions or banned medicines.
